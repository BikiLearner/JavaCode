What is a class in Java?
    A class is a group of objects which have common properties. It is a template or blueprint from which objects are created. It is a logical entity. It can't be physical.

    A class in Java can contain:

    Fields
    Methods
    Constructors
    Blocks
    Nested class and interface

    If a function is Inside a class then it is called a methods 

    To use long insert L at the end of number else java thinks it is an Integer long varName=1232324233L;
    for float do same float varName=12.32F


    String is a reference data type (non primititve)

    Array in java may or may not be contineus because of JVM ->as all object are stored in heap and heap is not
    contineus so we can say array in java are not contiueous
