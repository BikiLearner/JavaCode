# J shell to write java command in command prompt
#Java is strongly typed language

# 1 byte -> 8 bits

# java follows UNICODE in case of char so it takes 2 bytes

# u can use 0b(your binary number) in between to user binary number ( ex : int num =  0b0001) for hexa or others u can do so 
    search the internet and also u can put _ in between 00 for extra readability

# when u case from int data type to byte it does modulus operation ( % with maximum value of byte )
    ex:int r=20; byte b=(int) r;
    b=r % 256(highest value of byte)
# type promotion byte a=20; byte b=30; int c=a * b where (a * b) should produce byte but java
    say not to worry we promote them to int this is known a type promotion
# if you know the range then use for loop if u had some condition then use while or do while

# object has properties and behaviour

# instance variable is a part of heap not stack and local variable is the part of stack of
    particular function (Link : https://youtu.be/4XTsAAHW_Tc?t=12980)
# object is created in heap memory
# Array in java is an object 
    jagged array int num[][]=new int[2][];
        num[0]=new int [3];
        num[1]=new int [5];

# what is static keyword making something as a class member not a object member
    (https://youtu.be/4XTsAAHW_Tc?t=18339)
    static block is use to initialize static variable
    syntax: static{other = "Hi Moto"}

    you can use static variable in static method but you can't use non - static variable in
    static method

    why main needs to be static?
        Main method is the starting point of the program so if we do not make it static then
        we have to create the object of the class where main method is present but how can
        we create object without starting the program so it will be in a deadlock situation
    GPT explained
      1) The main method is called by the JVM before any objects of the class are created.
         Therefore, it must be declared as static to indicate that it belongs to the class
         itself,not to any specific instance of the class.
      2)No Object Creation: If the main method were not static,
        the JVM would require an object of the class containing the main method to call it.
        However, since main is the entry point, no objects have been created yet.
        This creates a circular dependency: to run the program, you
        need to create an object, but to create an object, you need to run the program.
      3)Deadlock Situation: As you correctly mentioned,
        if the main method were not static, creating an object to call main would
        lead to a deadlock situation, as it would require the program to start
        executing before it could create an object, and vice versa.


# Class.forName() it basically load your class if you want to load your class without
  creating any object it also throws exception name ClassNotBeFoundException

# this is a key word which represent current object (https://youtu.be/4XTsAAHW_Tc?t=20221)

# Every Class in java extend Object class (yes the name of the class is Object) it is by
    default and u cannot see it but it is there
    public class hello (invisible) extend Object{

    }
# Thread (https://youtu.be/4XTsAAHW_Tc?t=38051) in every the u need to have a run method

# Thread + Mutation is not an good Idea
# Thread safe mean only one thread can work with that at one point (Raise condition)
# To ensure that one thread at a time can access the variable we use synchronise key word in
    that method or variable

# states available to threads
    1) new state( when we create a thread)
    2) runnable state
    3) Running state
    4) waiting state
    5) dead state
