# J shell to write java command in command prompt
#Java is strongly typed language

# 1 byte -> 8 bits

# java follows UNICODE in case of char so it takes 2 bytes

# u can use 0b(your binary number) in between to user binary number ( ex : int num =  0b0001) for hexa or others u can do so 
    search the internet and also u can put _ in between 00 for extra readability

# when u case from int data type to byte it does modulus operation ( % with maximum value of byte )
    ex:int r=20; byte b=(int) r;
    b=r % 256(highest value of byte)
# type promotion byte a=20; byte b=30; int c=a * b where (a * b) should produce byte but java
    say not to worry we promote them to int this is known a type promotion
# if you know the range then use for loop if u had some condition then use while or do while

# object has properties and behaviour

# instance variable is a part of heap not stack and local variable is the part of stack of
    particular function (Link : https://youtu.be/4XTsAAHW_Tc?t=12980)
# object is created in heap memory
# Array in java is an object 
    jagged array int num[][]=new int[2][];
        num[0]=new int [3];
        num[1]=new int [5];
