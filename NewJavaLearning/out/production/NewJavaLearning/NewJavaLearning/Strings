# Mutable - change , Immutable - unchanged
# By default string is immutable (cannot be change)
# there is a special area in heap called "String constant pool"
# if you want mutable string "String buffer and string builder"

# String Buffer
    StringBuffer str=new StringBuffer("Hello Biki")
    str.capacity() (length + extra 16 bit to minimize the need for frequent relocations as
        string grows)
# string buffer is thread safe but string builder is not
